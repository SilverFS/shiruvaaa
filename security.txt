If you think you've identified a security issue on this or any other of my (sub)domains, 
please do not report the issue publicly via a mailing list, IRC, 
a public issue on issue trackers, a merge request, or any other public venue.

Instead, send an email to security@shiruvaaa.net. Please include as many details as possible, including a minimal reproducible example of the issue, and an idea of how exploitable/severe you think the issue is.
If you have possible patches which may fix the issue, please attach them to your security vulnerability report.


Thank you very much :3
